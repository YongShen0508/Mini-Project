# Application of genetic algorithms towards benchmark functions

## Project I
* Run 2 different selection operation technique, 2 mutation operation technique, 2 crossover operation technique, 2 replacement operation technique
* then every genetic algorithm model needs to test on 10 benchmark function
* then we need to run 10 times for each genetic algorithm model with benchmark function
* total : 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 10 * 10 = 1600

## Project II

* Run 4 different selection operation technique, 4 mutation operation technique, 4 crossover operation technique, 4 replacement operation technique
* then every genetic algorithm model needs to test on 10 benchmark function
* then we need to run 10 times for each genetic algorithm model with benchmark function****
* total : 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 10 * 10 = 25600
