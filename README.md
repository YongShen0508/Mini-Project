# Application of genetic algorithms towards benchmark functions

## Project I
* Run 2 different selection operation technique, 2 mutation operation technique, 2 crossover operation technique, 2 replacement operation technique
* then every genetic algorithm model needs to test on 10 benchmark function
* then we need to run 10 times for each genetic algorithm model with benchmark function

(only stupid people will run one by one)
let make this bullshit processes full automated
